# User Stories

Stories are organized by priority. MVP items must be delivered before launch; Stretch stories inform the post-MVP roadmap.

## MVP

### Sequencer Authoring
- As a **composer**, I want to place notes on a dot grid with 1/64th resolution so that I can create intricate rhythms.
- As a **composer**, I want the viewport to follow the playhead optionally so that I can stay oriented during playback.
- As a **composer**, I want to edit notes while the loop plays so that I can hear changes in real time.
- As a **composer**, I want to limit loop length to five minutes so that exported files stay manageable.

### Track Management
- As a **producer**, I want to add up to ten tracks with chiptune presets so that I can build layered arrangements.
- As a **producer**, I want per-track mute, solo, and volume control so that I can mix my loop quickly.
- As a **producer**, I want to rename tracks and assign colors so that I can organize my session.

### Scale Assistance
- As a **melodist**, I want to choose a musical scale so that grid notes highlight in-key tones.
- As a **melodist**, I want guidance when placing out-of-scale notes so that I can make intentional dissonance.

### Persistence & Sharing
- As a **user**, I want projects to autosave locally so that I never lose progress.
- As a **user**, I want to export my loop as audio and JSON so that I can share it with collaborators.
- As a **user**, I want to import a project JSON so that I can revise past ideas.

### Reliability & Performance
- As a **performer**, I want stable playback between 120–160 BPM so that live sets feel responsive.
- As a **performer**, I want immediate feedback (<100 ms) when editing during playback so that the interface feels snappy.

## Stretch (Post-MVP)
- As a **collaborator**, I want to co-edit a loop with another user in real time.
- As a **composer**, I want automation lanes for volume and filter sweeps.
- As a **performer**, I want a mobile layout for quick edits on my phone.
- As a **fan**, I want to publish loops to a community gallery.
