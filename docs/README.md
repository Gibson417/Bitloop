# Bitloop Documentation

This directory houses the planning, design, and workflow assets for the Bitloop MVP.
Use the sections below to locate the artifact you need.

## Directory Overview

- `design/` – Visual identity resources, including `design-tokens.json` for colors, type, and spacing.
- `process/` – Developer onboarding and delivery guides such as `quick_onboarding.md` and `build-checklist.md`.
- `product/` – Product planning material like `mvp-scope.md`, `milestone-plan.md`, and `user-stories.md`.
- `templates/` – Reusable GitHub issue templates (`ISSUES.md`).

## Recommended Reading Order

1. `process/quick_onboarding.md` for the development workflow and tooling setup.
2. `product/mvp-scope.md` to understand the feature boundaries of the release.
3. `product/user-stories.md` and `product/milestone-plan.md` for implementation context.
4. `design/design-tokens.json` when working on UI components.

All artifacts are living documents—update them as product decisions evolve or as implementation details are refined.
