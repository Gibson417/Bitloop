# Bitloop Documentation

This directory contains planning assets for the Bitloop MVP release. Start with the MVP scope and build checklist to understand the baseline deliverables, then reference supporting documents for design tokens, user stories, and milestone planning.

## Contents
- `mvp-scope.md`: Feature specification for the MVP release of the Bitloop web-based chiptune loop sequencer.
- `build-checklist.md`: Ordered checklist covering setup, implementation, QA, and launch steps.
- `design-tokens.json`: Shared design tokens for color, typography, spacing, and elevation.
- `user-stories.md`: User story backlog organized by priority and milestone.
- `milestone-plan.md`: Timeline and responsibility map for delivering the MVP milestones.

All artifacts are living documents. Update them as product decisions evolve or as implementation details are refined.
