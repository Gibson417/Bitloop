            This is an automatically updated release containing the latest Windows builds from the main branch.
            
            **Downloads:**
            - **UNKNOWN-Setup.exe** - Installer version with auto-update support
            - **UNKNOWN-Portable.exe** - Portable version (no installation required)
            
            **Note:** This is a development build and may contain bugs. For stable releases, please download a versioned release (e.g., v0.1.0).
            
            **Auto-Updates:** The installer version will automatically check for and install updates. The portable version requires manual download of new versions.
